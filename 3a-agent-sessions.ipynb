    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "\n",
      "**Key Areas of Advancement & Recent News:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug Discovery and Development:**\n",
      "    *   **Accelerated Research:** AI is revolutionizing drug discovery by rapidly analyzing vast datasets of biological and chemical information. Companies are using AI to identify potential drug candidates, predict their efficacy, and even design novel molecules.\n",
      "    *   **Personalized Medicine:** AI helps identify patient subgroups that are most likely to respond to specific treatments, paving the way for more personalized and effective therapies.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Recent news often highlights AI platforms that have significantly reduced the time and cost associated with early-stage drug discovery for various diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Diagnostic Imaging and Analysis:**\n",
      "    *   **Enhanced Accuracy and Speed:** AI algorithms are becoming increasingly adept at analyzing medical images (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, pathology slides) to detect subtle anomalies that might be missed by human eyes. This leads to earlier and more accurate diagnoses.\n",
      "    *   **Radiology and Pathology:** AI is widely being adopted in these fields to automate tasks like lesion detection, tumor segmentation, and disease classification.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Continuous reports emerge about AI models achieving or exceeding human-level performance in detecting conditions like diabetic retinopathy, certain cancers (breast, lung, prostate), and cardiovascular diseases from scans.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Predictive Analytics and Early Disease Detection:**\n",
      "    *   **Proactive Healthcare:** AI can analyze electronic health records (EHRs), wearable device data, and other patient information to predict the likelihood of developing certain diseases or experiencing adverse events (e.g., sepsis, hospital readmissions, falls).\n",
      "    *   **Personalized Risk Assessment:** This allows for early intervention and preventative care tailored to individual risk profiles.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Studies are frequently published demonstrating AI's ability to predict patient deterioration in intensive care units or identify individuals at high risk for chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease.\n",

      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to **Generative AI for Molecule Design**. This is a truly revolutionary aspect of AI in drug discovery. Let me elaborate on why it's so impactful and what's happening in this space:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is Generative AI for Molecule Design?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine having an artist who can paint incredibly complex and beautiful pictures based on a description. Generative AI in drug discovery is like that, but instead of paint and canvas, it uses algorithms to design entirely new **chemical structures** (molecules) that have never existed before.\n",
      "\n",
      "It works by training AI models on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. The AI learns the \"language\" of chemistry – how atoms connect, what makes a molecule stable, how it might interact with biological targets, and what properties contribute to efficacy and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once trained, these models can be instructed (or \"prompted\") to generate novel molecules that meet specific criteria. This is often referred to as **de novo drug design** (meaning \"from the beginning\").\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Capabilities and Advancements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Designing Molecules with Specific Properties:**\n",
      "    *   **Target Binding Affinity:** You can ask the AI to generate molecules that are highly likely to bind strongly to a particular protein target associated with a disease.\n",
      "    *   **Pharmacokinetic Properties (ADMET):** You can also guide the AI to design molecules that have desirable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and low toxicity profiles. This is crucial for a drug to be effective and safe in the human body.\n",
      "    *   **Solubility and Stability:** The AI can be instructed to create molecules that are soluble in water (important for delivery) and stable enough to survive in the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Exploring Vast Chemical Space:**\n",
      "    *   The number of possible drug-like molecules is astronomically large – far beyond what can be synthesized and tested in a traditional lab. Generative AI can efficiently explore this \"chemical space\" to find promising candidates that human chemists might not have conceived.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Accelerating the Lead Optimization Process:**\n",
      "    *   Instead of starting from scratch, a generative model can take an existing promising molecule (a \"lead compound\") and suggest modifications to improve its properties. This is much faster than traditional medicinal chemistry approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Designing for Specific Disease Modalities:**\n",
      "    *   While often associated with small molecules, generative AI is also being explored for designing peptides, antibodies, and even gene-editing components.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How it's Being Used (Examples and Companies):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Targeting \"Undruggable\" Diseases:** Many diseases are caused by proteins that are difficult to target with traditional drugs. Generative AI is being used to design molecules that can bind to these challenging targets.\n",
      "*   **Rapid Response to New Threats:** In situations like emerging pandemics, generative AI can quickly design potential therapeutics by analyzing the pathogen's genetic code and known drug interactions.\n",
      "*   **Reducing Costs and Time:** By automating the initial design phase and reducing the number of molecules that need to be synthesized and tested experimentally, generative AI has the potential to significantly cut down the time and cost of drug development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Prominent Players and Approaches:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** One of the pioneers, they have a well-publicized pipeline of drugs designed using their AI platform, with some candidates already progressing through clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Atomwise:** Focuses on structure-based drug design using deep learning to predict how small molecules will bind to proteins.\n",
      "*   **BenevolentAI:** Integrates AI for target identification, hypothesis generation, and molecule design.\n",
      "*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI to analyze cellular images and identify potential drug candidates.\n",
      "*   **Exscientia:** Develops AI-driven platforms for drug discovery and design.\n",
      "*   **Google DeepMind (AlphaFold):** While AlphaFold is primarily for protein structure prediction, this structural information is invaluable for generative AI models that design molecules to bind to those proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges and Future Outlook:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Experimental Validation is Still Key:** AI can design molecules, but they still need to be synthesized and rigorously tested in the lab and in clinical trials to confirm their safety and efficacy.\n",
      "*   **Data Quality:** The performance of generative AI models heavily relies on the quality and breadth of the training data.\n",
      "*   **Interpretability:** Sometimes, it's challenging to fully understand *why* an AI generated a particular molecule, which can be important for regulatory scrutiny and scientific understanding.\n",
      "*   **Integration with Synthesis:** Bridging the gap between AI design and efficient, scalable chemical synthesis remains an area of active research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these challenges, generative AI for molecule design represents a paradigm shift in drug discovery. It's moving us closer to a future where new medicines can be discovered and developed much more rapidly and effectively, potentially revolutionizing treatment for countless diseases.\n",
