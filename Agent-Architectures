That's the promise of multi-agent systems (MAS), a paradigm shift that's empowering developers to build more robust, efficient, and intelligent applications. Ready to see how?\n\n### Section 1: Enhanced Problem Solving and Complexity Management\n\n*   **Decomposition of Complex Tasks:** MAS allows you to break down large, daunting problems into smaller, manageable tasks, each handled by an agent with specific expertise. This makes even the most intricate software challenges approachable.\n*   **Distributed Intelligence:** Instead of a monolithic system, MAS distributes intelligence across multiple agents. This leads to more resilient systems where the failure of one agent doesn't cripple the entire application.\n*   **Parallel Processing and Efficiency:** Agents can work concurrently on different parts of a problem, significantly speeding up development and execution times. This is crucial for real-time applications and large-scale data processing.\n\n### Section 2: Improved Modularity, Reusability, and Maintainability\n\n*   **Independent Agent Development:** Each agent can be developed, tested, and updated independently. This modular approach streamlines the development lifecycle and reduces the risk of introducing bugs in other parts of the system.\n*   **Encouraging Reusable Components:** Well-defined agents with specific functionalities become natural building blocks. These agents can be reused across different projects, saving significant development effort and promoting best practices.\n*   **Easier Debugging and Maintenance:** When a problem arises, developers can pinpoint the problematic agent rather than sifting through massive codebases.

Perched regally on a dowel, a miniature sunbeam with wings, was the most beautiful pineapple conure she’d ever laid eyes on. His emerald green body was splashed with vibrant yellow and fiery orange across his chest and crown, like a sunset captured. He tilted his head, a curious glint in his intelligent dark eyes, as if assessing her.\n\n“He’s a special one,” the pet shop owner murmured. Maya was already lost. She reached out a finger, and he tentatively stepped onto it, his tiny claws a gentle pressure. A soft chirp, like a musical question, escaped him. That was it. She was buying him. She’d named him Pip before she even left the store.\nCriticAgent > The story has a strong emotional opening and a clear, immediate goal for the character. The descriptive language for the bird is excellent. However, the story feels very short and abrupt, like the beginning of something larger.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Develop the interaction and connection:** While the initial step onto the finger is a good start, consider adding a few more moments that solidify Maya's connection with Pip. Perhaps he nips gently, preens a feather on her finger, or makes a more complex sound. This would further justify her immediate decision to buy him and make their bond feel more earned.\n2.  **Show, don't just tell, Maya's feelings:** The phrase \"Maya was already lost\" tells us she's smitten, but showing it would be more impactful. How does her expression change? Does she forget her surroundings? Does she feel a sense of calm or excitement that overpowers her usual decision-making process?\n3.  **Consider expanding the \"after\" moment:** The story ends as she's leaving the store. What happens on the car ride home? What is her initial impression of Pip in a new environment? Even a few more sentences could provide a more satisfying sense of conclusion for this vignette, or it could serve as a stronger hook if this is intended to be the beginning of a longer piece.\nRefinerAgent > Maya’s heart fluttered the moment she saw him. Perched regally on a dowel, a miniature sunbeam with wings, was the most beautiful pineapple conure she’d ever laid eyes on. His emerald green body was splashed with vibrant yellow and fiery orange across his chest and crown, like a sunset captured. He tilted his head, a curious glint in his intelligent dark eyes, as if assessing her.\n\n“He’s a special one,” the pet shop owner murmured, his voice a low rumble that barely registered in Maya's ears. She felt a warmth spread through her chest, a giddy excitement bubbling up that made her usually pragmatic mind fuzzy. Her eyes softened, a gentle smile gracing her lips as she forgot the bustling shop around her, her entire world narrowing to the exquisite creature before her. She reached out a finger, and he tentatively stepped onto it, his tiny claws a gentle pressure against her skin. He nibbled softly at her cuticle, a playful, inquisitive gesture, before letting out a soft chirp, like a musical question. Then, as if making a decision, he snuggled closer, preening a stray feather on her finger with his beak. That was it. She was buying him. She’d named him Pip before she even left the store.\n\nThe car ride home was a symphony of quiet chirps and Maya’s soft reassurances. Pip sat on her shoulder, occasionally nibbling her earlobe, his vibrant colors a stark contrast against her dark jacket. He seemed unfazed by the new surroundings, exploring her hair with his beak and making little contented noises. Maya kept glancing at him in the rearview mirror, her heart swelling with a protective affection she hadn't anticipated. This wasn't just a pet; it was a connection, a tiny spark of joy that had somehow found its way into her life. As they pulled into her driveway, Maya knew her life had just become a lot more colorful.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

You're Now an Agent Orchestrator\n\nIn this notebook, you made the leap from a single agent to a **multi-agent system**.\n\nYou saw **why** a team of specialists is easier to build and debug than one \"do-it-all\" agent. Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions. You also mastered the \"plumbing\" by using `output_key` to pass state between agents and make them collaborative.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n- [Sequential Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/)\n- [Parallel Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/)\n- [Loop Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/)\n- [Custom Agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/custom-agents/)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps\n\nReady for the next challenge?
